Project Euler Solutions (Python)
This repository contains my Python solutions to various Project Euler problems: a collection of challenging mathematical and computational 
puzzles designed to sharpen your problem-solving and programming skills. Visit https://projecteuler.net/ to see the complete list of problems. 


About Project Euler
“Project Euler exists to encourage, challenge, and develop the skills and enjoyment of anyone with an interest in the fascinating world of mathematics and computer programming.”
Each problem combines mathematical insight with efficient algorithm design, often requiring creative approaches to handle large computations.


Goals
- Strengthen understanding of mathematics and algorithmic logic
- Practice clean, efficient, and readable Python code
- Explore different techniques (iteration, recursion, etc.)
- Build consistency through continuous problem-solving
